# About

**NOTE:** The software is still in development and will work.

Configspack is a post-install script for any UNIX-like systems and is written purely with Bash. Easily customize your dotfiles with this script without knowing the exact lines for each setting.

There is a config.json file that lets you add new settings to your liking, and even custom settings.

Bring your setup to whichever new system you're setting up with `saved_configs.txt`.
